# Echocheck

**Echocheck** is a web app that helps spot “echo chamber” effects in any YouTube video. It listens to what’s said in the video, then checks whether the ideas are balanced—or if they mostly reinforce the same point of view.

## What It Does

1. **Three Perspectives**  
   - **The Advocate** looks for arguments **in favor** of the main idea.  
   - **The Skeptic** searches for **questions and doubts**.  
   - **The Synthesizer** brings it all together and finds the overall picture.

2. **Live Progress**  
   As each perspective works, you see their thoughts flow onto the screen—almost like three experts talking in real time.

3. **Final Report**  
   Once they’re done, you get:
   - **Echo Score**: A number (0–100) that shows how much the video echoes the same viewpoint.  
     - High score → likely an echo chamber  
     - Lower score → more balance and debate  
   - **Main Arguments**: Key points the video makes  
   - **Missing Counterpoints**: Important questions or opposing views that don’t show up  
   - **Agent Notes**: Full write-ups from each of the three “agents”

## How to Try It

1. **Enter** the YouTube link.  
2. **Ask** what perspective you want checked (e.g., “Does this video push a single political message?”).  
3. **Click** **Analyze**.  
4. **Watch** the three “agents” think aloud, then read your final Echo Score and summary.

## Why It Matters

Videos (and podcasts, news clips, etc.) can slip into echo chambers—where you only hear one side of a story. Echocheck gives you a quick, clear way to see if a video is balanced or if it’s mostly preaching to the choir.
